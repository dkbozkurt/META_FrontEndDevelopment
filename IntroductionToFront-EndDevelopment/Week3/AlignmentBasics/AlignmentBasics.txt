text-align : justify

Text alignment can be set to left, right, center and justify. The justify
alignment spreads the text out so that every line of the text has the same
width.


If you want to align an inline element like img, you will need to change it to a
block-level element. Similar to the div example, you add the img to a parent
element:

<div class="parent">
  <img src="photo.png" class="child">
</div>

To be more precise, in CSS you can set only the left and right margins to auto.
This allows you to set the top and bottom margins to specific values if needed.

.child {
  display: block;
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}


float: right; 

The float property sets an element's position relative to the text content
within a parent element. Text will wrap around the element.
