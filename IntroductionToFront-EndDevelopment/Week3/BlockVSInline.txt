Block elements vs Inline elements

It's important to remember that block elements begin on a new line and take up
the full width of the page. And in line elements work within the flow of
surrounding content rather than breaking onto their own line.

Common block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <li>, <table>,
<form>, and more.

Common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <br>, and <i>
(for italics).
